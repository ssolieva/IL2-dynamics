## md-files (all contain C125S mutation (C123S for Seq1))
	--- simulation-run-files | files to run simulations. MDP files, submission files, etc.
	--- simulation-start-frames | starting structures before and after equilibrium. 
		|--- after_equilibration | structures that the FAST simulations were started from.
